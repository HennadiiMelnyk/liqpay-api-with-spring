# LiqPay Java SDK

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e4e798208c9a4364bb440c2d4b5cbecd)](https://app.codacy.com/app/HennadiiMelnyk/liqpay-api-with-spring?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=HennadiiMelnyk/liqpay-api-with-spring&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Inspired from official Java SDK https://github.com/liqpay/sdk-java.
The main benefit is the use of RestTemplate from Spring, which is threadsafe. 
This point was the main motivation, when we developed this project.  

### Requirements
 - JDK 1.7 or higher
 - Spring any version with RestTemplate (we were using the version **4.2.9.RELEASE** for our tests)
 
### Usage

TBD
