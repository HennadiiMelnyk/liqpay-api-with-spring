# LiqPay Java SDK

Inspired from official Java SDK https://github.com/liqpay/sdk-java.
The main benefit is the use of RestTemplate from Spring, which is threadsafe. 
This point was the main motivation, when we developed this project.  

### Requirements
 - JDK 1.7 or higher
 - Spring any version with RestTemplate (we were using the version **4.2.9.RELEASE** for our tests)
 
### Usage

TBD
